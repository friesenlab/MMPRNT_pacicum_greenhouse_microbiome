**Analysis**

This repo holds a workflow script to process Illumina sequencing read data with qiime2, statistical analysis in phyloseq R, and plots in ggplot2.  

**Data**

Raw data, processed data, ASVs files, scripts are also at Open Science Framework (OSF) repo [link](https://osf.io/sta58/)<br />
